India Census
I bring this data from the Census India website
https://censusindia.gov.in/census.website/data/census-tables
With the help of these data, I got some results like :
Create summary tables that aggregate and present important statistics.
Use GROUP BY and aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) to summarize data at different levels.

Problem Questions  are -
-> What was the average growth of India
-> avg growth by state,avg sex ratio
 -> states who are above 90% in average literacy rate
 -> Top 3 state showing the highest growth rate
 -> bottom 3 states showing lowest sex ratio
 -> top & bottom 3 states in literacy state
 -> states starting with letters a and b
 -> join  the tables and get the sex_ratio,population state & district wise and total males and females
